#Project Title: Pintos

##Introduction
This project is an implementation of a basic operating system called Pintos. The goal of this project was to implement several features, including tokenisation of user argument input from terminal, stack management and argument alignment, and testing and integration of developed system calls.

##Implemented Features
The following features were implemented in this project:

**Tokenisation of user argument input from terminal** - This feature allows the user to input command line arguments in the terminal, which are then tokenised and passed to the relevant function in the Pintos operating system.

**Stack management and argument alignment** - This feature ensures that the stack is properly managed and aligned so that the operating system can execute the desired function without encountering any errors.

**Testing and integration of developed system calls** - This feature involves testing the developed system calls to ensure they function correctly and integrating them into the Pintos operating system.

##Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install any required dependencies.
Run the tests to ensure everything is working correctly.
Start using Pintos!

##Usage
To use Pintos, follow these steps:

Open the terminal and navigate to the directory where Pintos is installed.
Enter the desired command line arguments.
Press enter to execute the desired function.

##Conclusion
In conclusion, this project successfully implemented several important features in the Pintos operating system, including tokenisation of user argument input from terminal, stack management and argument alignment, and testing and integration of developed system calls. With these features in place, Pintos is now a more robust and reliable operating system that can be used for a variety of applications.
