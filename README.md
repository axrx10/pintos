#Pintos Project: 
#User Argument Tokenisation, Stack Management, and System Call Integration
##Overview
This Pintos project implements three important features in operating system design: tokenisation of user argument input from terminal, stack management and argument alignment, and testing and integration of developed system calls. The implemented features improve the user experience by making the operating system more user-friendly and efficient.

##Features
###User Argument Tokenisation
This feature tokenises user input from the terminal to make it easier for the operating system to process. It helps users to input commands and arguments with more flexibility, as they don't have to worry about formatting the input in a specific way.

###Stack Management and Argument Alignment
This feature improves the efficiency of the operating system by managing the stack more effectively. It aligns the arguments in the stack so that they can be accessed more easily by the operating system. This results in faster and more efficient execution of system calls.

###Testing and Integration of Developed System Calls
This feature ensures that the implemented system calls are working as expected. It involves testing the system calls in different scenarios to verify that they work in all situations. The system calls are also integrated into the operating system to make them available for use by applications.

##Getting Started
To use this project, you need to clone the repository to your local machine. Then, you can build the project and run the tests to verify that everything is working as expected.

##Prerequisites
Pintos
GCC

##Installation
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-repo-url.git
Build the project: make
Run the tests: make check

##Usage
Once the project is built and the tests have passed, you can use it like any other operating system. You can run applications and system calls as usual, and the implemented features will be automatically applied.

##Conclusion
This Pintos project implements important features in operating system design that improve the user experience and efficiency. The implemented features have been tested and integrated into the operating system to make them available for use by applications. Overall, this project is a significant improvement to the Pintos operating system.
